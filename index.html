The “Trade-In Value” of your vehicle is an estimate, only, and many factors that cannot be assessed without a physical inspection of the vehicle 
may affect actual value. For purposes of this website, we use the services of a third-party vendor to provide Trade-In Value calculations. While 
we believe this information is reliable, we are not responsible for and do not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of the information. Please 
see your local Ford dealer for information regarding actual trade-in availability and value.

27.
Don’t drive while distracted or while using handheld devices. Use voice-operated systems when possible. Some features may be locked out while 
the vehicle is in gear. Not all features are compatible with all phones.

28.
The vehicle's electrical system (including the battery), the wireless service provider's signal and a connected mobile phone must all be available 
and operating for 911 Assist to function properly. These systems may become damaged in a crash. The paired mobile phone must be connected to SYNC, 
and the 911 Assist feature enabled, in order for 911 to be dialed. When the feature is ON, 911 Assist uses your paired and connected mobile phone to 
assist occupants to contact emergency services by dialing 911 if your airbag deploys or, on certain vehicles, if the emergency fuel pump shut-off 
is activated. Aftermarket on-board diagnostic devices may interfere with various vehicle systems including Vehicle Health Report and 911 Assist. 
To avoid interference, remove the device or contact the device maker for more information on compatibility.
